## Start Here

This is a WIP repository.  Basically we are using the Validated Patterns framework to deploy the resources needed for the 
OpenShift AI training that was done on March 4 - 6.

## Rationale

The goal for this pattern is to:

* Use a GitOps approach to manage the OpenShift AI training deployments across both public and private clouds.

The Validated Patterns framework also allows:
* Enable cross-cluster governance and application lifecycle management.
* Securely manage secrets across the deployment.

This basically deploys the resources found in the following repo: https://github.com/openshift-ai-examples/openshift-ai-examples/tree/main/openshift-ai-install
